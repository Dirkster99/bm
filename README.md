# Breadcrumb.Metro

This project implements an open source Breadcrumb control that was originally developed by <b>Leung Yat Chun Joseph <a href="https://github.com/lycj">lycj</a></b> in his FileExplorer application originating from CodePlex and <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Members/Fainx">CodeProject</a>.

The implementation of the Windows Shell Browser in [WSF](https://github.com/Dirkster99/WSF) is based on LYCJ's interfaces but completely refactored in terms of models and classes using [SharpShell](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpshell) as base of most things that are there.

The AutoComplete portion of this control is implemented in a separate [SuggestionBoxLib](https://github.com/Dirkster99/SuggestBoxLib) project:
